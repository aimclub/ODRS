Welcome to FEDOT Industrial's documentation!
============================================

Here you can find comprehensive documentation for the
`FEDOT.Industrial framework <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/Fedot.Industrial>`__ for automated
machine learning.

It provides a set of tools for solving several problems related to time series and computer vision:
anomaly detection, classification, and object detection and classification.

The framework is based on the FEDOT_ framework using its algorithmic
kernel in terms of evolutionary optimization and obtaining graph-like
pipelines for classification.
