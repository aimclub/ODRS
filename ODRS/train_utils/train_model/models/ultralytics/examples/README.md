## How can you contribute ?

We're looking for examples, applications and guides from the community. Here's how you can contribute:

- Make a PR with `[Example]` prefix in title after adding your project folder in the examples/ folder of the repository
- The project should satisfy these conditions:
  - It should use ultralytics framework
  - It have a README.md with instructions to run the project
  - It should avoid adding large assets or dependencies unless absolutely needed
  - The contributor is expected to help out in issues related to their examples

If you're unsure about any of these requirements, make a PR and we'll happy to guide you
